mwdum.py
========

MWDumpy takes a Mediawiki-XML-Dump and outputs SQL statements



I built this script due to frustration with mwdumper.
It's currently slower than mwdumper, however it doesn't throw nasty UTF-8 Exceptions. Speedups are on the roadmap for v0.2.
Plus the source code is super slim and easily hackable.
